                        As the world looks to China in awe, the middle kingdom itself is strengthening ties with its immediate neighbours. <br />
						In fact, Russia and China will send 10,000 students to each other’s countries, to strengthen international relations as part of the Youth Friendly Exchanges Year. <br />
						Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong said:<br />
						"We will launch a youth exchange program that involves 100 schools and 10,000 students from each country.<br />
						"We will earnestly plan and prepare for the opening ceremony of the youth year to be held in Russia next spring...<br />
                            "We will earnestly plan and prepare for the opening ceremony of the youth year to be held in Russia next spring
                            <br />
                            Liu feels there is an opportunity to increase friendly cooperation and further the China-Russia strategic partnership. 
                            <br />
                            In addition, one million students will be able to engage online with the hope of increasing the numbers of Chinese-Russian translation students. 
                            <br />
                            Furthermore, the two countries will work together at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games and send young athletes to the sixth China-Russia Youth Games as well. 
                            <br />
                            Other countries including India and the UK are looking at forming relationships with China, undoubtedly highlighting the global influence the country has. Of course the communist history shared with Russia and China will play a large part in the ways they move forward socially, economically and politically.
