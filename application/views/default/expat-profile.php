                    <p> I decided to go to China for a few differe ibrant and booming economy. Companies across the globe are vying to do business with China and having first-hand knowledge of Chinese business culture would be a real asset to my professional development. Another reason I chose China is because the culture is so different and it would be a completely new and interesting experience. As soon as I arrived in China, I knew that I had made the right choice. China is so vibrant and diverse that no 2 days are the same and there is never an opportunity to be bored.
